## Overview

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://choropleth-map.freecodecamp.rocks.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. 

**User Story #1:** My choropleth should have a title with a corresponding id="title". <br>
**User Story #2:** My choropleth should have a description element with a corresponding id="description". <br>
**User Story #3:** My choropleth should have counties with a corresponding class="county" that represent the data. <br>
**User Story #4:** There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties. <br>
**User Story #5:** My counties should each have data-fips and data-education properties containing their corresponding fips and education values. <br>
**User Story #6:** My choropleth should have a county for each provided data point. <br>
**User Story #7:** The counties should have data-fips and data-education values that match the sample data. <br>
**User Story #8:** My choropleth should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend". <br>
**User Story #9:** There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend. <br>
**User Story #10:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area. <br>
**User Story #11:** My tooltip should have a data-education property that corresponds to the data-education of the active area. <br>

Here are the datasets you will need to complete this project:

- US Education Data:https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/for_user_education.json
- US County Data:https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/counties.json
